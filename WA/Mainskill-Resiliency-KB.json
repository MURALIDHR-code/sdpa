                "text": "1.\tIntroduction to ROP\nThe Rapid Open Provisioning (ROP) portal is a website that allows you to provide IBM with information with which to set up your Intel / Client Server environment.  ROP accepts data regarding UCS Blades (e.g. compute resources), legacy physical servers (e.g. IBM 3850’s and HPDL), VDI workplace and tape library requirements.  \n\nUsing ROP you create a \"project\" and specify your recovery data, submitting it so that IBM has it for disaster recovery exercises and at time of disaster, similar to having information on file with IBM in the form of a worksheet.  The advantage of using ROP is that it allows IBM Resiliency Services to employ automations to deploy the project and build the recovery environment quickly, giving our customers a faster RPO.  \n\nBenefits of ROP:\n\tROP portal provides you the ability to input and manage an Intel event configuration via a web portal.\n\tROP transforms the way we deliver our services to you by automating the provisioning of ESXi, Windows, Linux, vCenter Servers and VMs on CISCO UCS Servers.\n\tROP also allows you to include Non-UCS Servers and equipment, such as Legacy Servers – IBM3850 and HPDL, VDI Workplace and Tape Library into your project.\n\tThe provisioning of services can be performed without manual intervention or the risk of configuration errors leading to performance issues or system failures during event of disaster. \n\tCustomization of basic client server configuration such as hostname, service profile, network configuration and SVC SAN disk are automatically performed via UCS workflow.\n\t System builds can be completely standardised, incorporating best practices. \n\n2.\tAccessing the ROP customer portal:\nEach ROP user has to have an IBM ID.  If you do not already have one, please register for an ID at www.IBM.com.  Typically, you use your regular organization’s email address as your IBM ID.    After obtaining an IBM ID, contact your SDPA and provide the first and last name and the IBM ID of each person you wish to have access to ROP for your organization.  Once this has been completed you can log in to the portal and create a recovery project.  This project is saved in the database for future retrieval or modification.  Once submitted, an IBM admin can login in to the portal and approve or modify the recovery project and submit it for automated provisioning.\n\nThis is the ROP URL:  https://ropus.mybluemix.net\n\nFor existing clients who previously filled out an IBM Intel workbook, we are retiring the workbook altogether in favour of using ROP, which will accept all data that used to be placed on the workbook. The portal is easy to use and the always on nature of the portal encourages you to keep the data inside \"recovery ready\" as well as using it to give IBM testing configuration requirements. It also eliminates the need for IBM to make, and you to review and approve, setup documentation.  The info you put in the portal is \"wysiwyg\" and IBM will build according to it, no setup documents required.  You are encouraged to use ROP in place of filling out an Intel workbook as we will be retiring the Intel workbook at the end of 2020 and no longer accepting it for test preparation in 2021. \n"

These items must be added to the contract to ensure the client is recovery ready. Refer to the Customer Support Team Room Database. Under Process and Procedures – One Time Charge Process\nSteps are: Fill Out OTC Pricing Request form and forward to assign PA’s at your site to create a work authorization. Copy: IBM RS Upgrades Database\n\nA One Time Charge will be generated for the requested services.\nAfter receiving client approval for the price and scope, a Work Authorization for Additional Services will be generated and sent to you.  \nReview the document for accuracy, send to the client for signature, and countersign the Work Authorization.  Only an IBM employee can countersign the document.\nAfter the client and IBM signatures have been obtained, scan the Work Authorization and store in COMDOC as SALES - Letter of Authorization.  For IGA Accounts, an email approval of the Work Authorization is acceptable.  Please generate a PDF of the email and store it in COMDOC as above.\n"
