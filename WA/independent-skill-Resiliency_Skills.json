To that end IBM has been designing a suite of programs (collectively known as IRIS) designed to eliminate pretest worksheets and streamline your DR planning effort.  Right now we are ready to beta test our IRIS Open Systems worksheet replacement discovery tool, \"SysSnap\", and I believe you are a strong candidate to participate.  SysSnap collects configuration data for automatic worksheet generation and equipment provisioning and provides numerous efficiencies to your organization's continuity program.  There is no cost to participate in this beta program, however there are numerous benefits to you, some of which include the following: \n\nAUTO Generated Worksheets\n\t\n\t-All system configuration data (Storage, CPU, Memory, OS levels, Network) is reposed at \n\tIBM\n\t-You never have to fill out a worksheet again\n\nALWAYS ready DR Configuration\n\n\t-IBM has up to date requirements instantly on hand during an outage emergency\n\t-Data collection can be automated via a scheduled job\n\t-Production changes are captured as they happen and do not require client intervention\n\t-Ensured accuracy of \"deliverable\" documentation\n\t-IBM can ensure contract matches production environment where applicable\n\nPRETEST Efficiency\n\n\t-IBM provides worksheet for client approval\n\t-Minimal pretest call\n\t-You get time back on your schedule\n\nNEXT Level DR/Client Benefit\n\n\t-Be on the forefront of IBM's transformation\n\t-Data collection used as provisioning input\n\t-Reduced labor planning costs\n\t-Possibly reduce RTO\n\n\nI am not quite sure about the term @object_of_interest.

Set them up with SysSnap and verify we're receiving data.  When you're getting ready to pretest the test, find out what LPARS they want to test.\n\nSet them up on Syssnap first.\nFind out what LPARS they want to test.\n\nWhen preparing for test, go here:\nhttps://syssnap.sterlingforest.ibm.com/\n\n\nSelect your account:\n  \n\nSelect the rdws_summary.html\n  \n\nselect the LPARS they indicated (no VIO servers should be on the list)  Press right arrow to move names to middle box.  \n  \n\nUnder Target System, select the target server they're allocated.for the exercise.  Click PowerVM Worksheet to generate worksheet for DRX. \n\nSend to customer as the worksheet you'll be reviewing on pretest call. \n"

If the Service Delivery Program Advisor that is primarily responsible for the customer needs a Service Delivery Program Advisor at the scheduled site to assist with the exercise, it is the Primary Service Delivery Program Advisor’s responsibility to send a note to the Cross Site Assignor at the scheduled site requesting assistance.  If the exercise is to take place insideT10, the owing SDPA must gather all approvals from the cross-site. \n\nThe originating site Service Delivery Program Advisor will offer the date to the customer and confirm back to the scheduler.  Refer to the Cross Site SDPA Roles document in the Customer Support Team Room under SDPA Process, View this Section, All Sites, Cross Site SDPA Roles for further details on this subject.\n"

Been my experience IBM works with customers in situations even if it isn’t spelled out sometimes\nPoint is I don’t want to convey at 6 weeks we get kicked out physically.\nI’d prefer to report we are contractually allowed 6 weeks and then we would have to negotiate with IBM if we still needed to continue for some reason\nCan you confirm IBM would or would not be open to that if it occurred`\nI See, There is some legal language that we can add to customer contract that will let them stay another six weeks but it does raise the price 50% to do so. This was created after the Covid situation started so is not in there current contract.\nTeam, any advise, or feedback on this Customers query?. (edited) "

As per SRT, this activity covers under Item Code : xxx.xx with rate code A i.e, $ xxx per hour.     Already informed the customer on the rates and activities.  But, still they are looking for a quote/soa for thier internal account purpose.    Do we provide such ? if so, should I follow OTC process to WA ?`\n\nAns:-I would start by determining how many tapes and ask RTP Tape Team for estimate of time then you can provide email with that - we would not provide a work authorization for the activity - and it’s an “estimate” based on information provided by the client etc."

The contract defines an “Outage Emergency” as follows:   \n“An Outage Emergency is any unplanned interruption of your critical business and information processing at a Covered Address, resulting from causes beyond your control that significantly impairs your ability to operate your business.”   \nSome examples of an unplanned interruption include:  \n • Building or region evacuation mandated by Public Authorities impacting access to buildings, systems, network, facilities  \n • Destruction of systems or network due to a natural disaster (fire, flood, wind etc.) \n  • Unanticipated loss of power or network   .\n \n*There is a recovery only contract,  for the real disaster to activate,( In your case it is  CFXXXXX ) in the event of the real disaster. or to place an alert, as a proactive measure. \n*Look at the contract and discuss IBM RS contractual commitment for these, based on your contact entitlements: \n*Configuration turn-over (typically 24 hours, but not always). \n*Coldsite entitlements. \n*Discuss COE and COE network support.  (See Q&A below)\n*Discuss the customer's responsibility for data erasure, the time needed to perform it, and *IBM RS's options for data erasure.  \n\n`Client FAQs `\n`Question:  When can you declare?  `\nAnswer: If you are under a state of Emergency causing loss of access to your site, road closures, evacuation orders -  that does qualify as a condition to declare.\n\n`Question:  Can you send people in advance of the potential disaster?   `\nAnswer:  While we are available to respond to your needs, you can only send people to a delivery center after you have called in to declare an outage emergency and been placed in one of our delivery centers.\n\n`Question:  Can you send tapes in advance?`\nAnswer:  Remind them to keep in mind, your placement in a IBM RS center is dependent on when you declare an outage emergency.  Therefore, if you send your tapes in advance you may need to arrange to ship the tapes to another location, if your placement location is not where you originally shipped them to\n\n`Question:  Will IBM RS contact our network service provider about an outage on a circuit we own?  `\nAnswer:  No.  It is up to the circuit owner to work with the service provider.  IBM RScannot contact service providers for circuits on the customer's behalf.    \n\n`Question:  What will IBM RS do to help diagnose customer owned circuit issues? ` \nAnswer:  IBM RS will determine if the IBM RS environment is operational.  There may be a charge for more advanced problem determination activities.  After the current situation is resolved, your BCRS client representative will be happy to discuss options that would allow IBM RS to work with network connectivity vendors.\n\n`Question:  What if the customer's BCP is out of synch with IBM RS's' contractual obligations?  `\nAnswer:  After the current situation is resolved, your IBM RSclient representative will be happy to discuss options that would more closely align IBM RS' contractual obligations with your BCP.\n\n`Will there be charge if customer places an alert`\n*No*"
